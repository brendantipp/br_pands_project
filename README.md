Project Plan
1. Created Repository both local and on Github
2. Added readme file to which contains a summary of data set below and my investigations
2. Reasearched Fishers Iris Dat Set and worte summary as found below
3. Downloaded Fishers Irish data set to local repository
4. Created program named anlysis.py which
	- outputs a summary of each variable to a single text file
	- saves a histogram of each variable to png files - you will find these png files here ( )
	- outputs a scatter plot of each of the pair of variables

Fishers Iris Data Set - Summary

The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper “The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems” as an example of linear discriminant analysis.
It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species.
Two of the three species were collected in the Gaspé Peninsula "all from the same pasture, and picked on the same day and measured at the same time by the same person with the same apparatus".[3] 
The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor).
Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.
Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other.
Based on Fisher's linear discriminant model, this data set became a typical test case for many statistical classification techniques in machine learning such as support vector machines.
The iris data set is widely used as a beginner's dataset for machine learning purposes.
